>"One of the things that Baidu did well early on was to create an internal platform for deep learning. What that did was enable engineers all across the company, including people who were not AI researchers, to leverage deep learning in all sorts of creative ways - applications that an AI researcher like me never would have thought of" -- Andrew Ng

The vast majority of data has been created within the last decade. In turn many fields of research are confronted with an unprecented wealth of data. The sheer amount of information but also the complexity of modern datasets continues to point a kind researcher to programming approaches who had not considered programming to process data so far. *DevOps Carpentry* aims at two things: First, to give a big picture overview and starting point to reach what the open source software community calls a 'software carpentry' level. Second, the book gives an understanding of the opportunities of automation and reproducibility as well as the effort to maintain the required environment. This book argues a solid software carpentry skill level and self-operation is totally in reach for most researchers. And most importantly, investing is worth the effort: being able to code leverages field specific expertise and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration as source code continues to become an important communication channel.

## Acknowledgements

I am thankful for the inspiration, help and perspectives of everyone who contributed to this book at its different stages. There are several people and organizations, I would like to thank in particular. 

First, I would like to thank David Grubbs from CRC for getting me started. 
From our first meeting at useR! in Toulouse, France, David helped streamline writing a book and he kept adding value throughout the process with his remarks and contacts. 
I would like to thank Achim Zeileis who also played an important role at this early stage of my book project. Achim did not only inspire me to become a co-host for useR! which lead to many experiences that became important to this book. Our discussions about teaching amplified my motivation to have good material to accompany my own course -- which clearly turned out to be one of the most important drivers in the long run. 

In that regard I would like to thank all participants of my *Hacking for ...* courses.
Your insights, questions, feedback and semester projects have been invaluable to this project. 
Your field specific expertise is inspirational not only to me but also to readers of the book as it shows the broad relevance of the approach. 
I would like to thank ETH Zurich, in particularly the Department of Management, Technology and Economics (D-MTEC) and the KOF Swiss Economic Institute for hosting my ideas over the last 13 years. 
Thank you to educational developers Karin Brown und Erik Jentges - having teaching professionals with open ears and minds around helped to channel motivation and ideas into course that continues to be popular among participants across departments and disciplines. 
Torboern Netlandt deserves credit for enabling this widespread interest.
His early advice turned what was initially though of as *Hacking for Economists* into *Hacking for Social Sciences* which became *Hacking for Science*. 

R community in Switzerland and worldwide

- Siegfried Heiler, Toni Stocker for pointing me to R
- too many to thank everyone
- well represented by Dorothea, Roc√≠o, Yani, Heather
- Zurich R user group
