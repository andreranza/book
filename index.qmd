The vast majority of data has been created within the last decade. In turn many fields of research are confronted with an unprecented wealth of data. The sheer amount of information but also the complexity of modern datasets continues to point a kind researcher to programming approaches who had not considered programming to process data so far. *DevOps for Data Analysis* aims at two things: First, to give a big picture overview and starting point to reach what the open source software community calls a 'software carpentry' level. Second, the book gives an understanding of the opportunities of automation and reproducibility as well as the effort to maintain the required environment. This book argues a solid software carpentry skill level and self-operation is totally in reach for most researchers. And most importantly, investing is worth the effort: being able to code leverages field specific expertise and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration as source code continues to become an important communication channel.
